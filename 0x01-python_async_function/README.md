## Python Async Function
### Description
To understand the following concepts:
- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module

asyncio is a library to write concurrent code using the **async/await** syntax.
asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database conncection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.
async is often a perfect fit for IO-bound and high-level structured network code.
